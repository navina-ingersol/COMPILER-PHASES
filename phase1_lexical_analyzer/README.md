# 🧩 Phase 1 – Lexical Analyzer  
### Compiler Design Project (Python Implementation)

---

## 📌 Description

This project implements **Phase 1 of a Compiler – Lexical Analysis** using Python.

The lexical analyzer reads source code from an input file and converts it into tokens such as:

- Keywords  
- Identifiers  
- Operators  
- Numbers  
- Separators  

This is the **first stage** of the compilation process.
